    <strong>What are Web Beacons?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We may advertise on third-party web sites. As part of our effort to track
    the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor
    identification technology such as “web beacons”, or “action tags”, which
    count visitors who have come to the website after being exposed to a
    SharePass banner or on a third-party site. We do not use this technology to
    access your personal information and it is only used to compile aggregated
    statistics about visitors who come to the website to gauge the effectiveness
    of our ads.

    <strong>What is a Cookie?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    A “cookie” is a technology that allows the website to store tokens of
    information (an “identifier”) in your browser used by the website while you
    are on the website. Cookies are then sent back to the website on each
    subsequent visit, or to another webpage that recognises that cookie. Cookies
    are used in order to make the website work, or to work more efficiently, as
    well as to provide information to the owners of the website.

  <p>
    Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages
    efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user
    experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited the
    website before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help to
    ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your
    interests.
